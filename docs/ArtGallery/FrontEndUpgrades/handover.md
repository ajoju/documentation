## Open Issues

The purpose of this section is to flag things that may interfere with the future team's ability to work on the project and to give advice on how these issues could be fixed in the future.

- Software compatibility issues arose when team members used different versions of software.
- Team members faced illnesses, leading to work delays.
- Lack of knowledge in front-end software resulted in additional time spent on the learning procedure.
- Prettier errors in documents, which were resolved but took significant time to explore the correct way to rectify them.

## Other Relevant Information

- We have created a Figma board to redesign the website. Students in the next trimester can work on it to implement new features.
- We have arranged the Vue element codes of the front-end in a meaningful way and will continue to improve and test properly in the coming days. This will enable students to concentrate more on the website designing elements than the codes.
- We have created some learning documents and more are underway. These will be very helpful for new team members who are beginners in front-end development.
